Hi,
I am excited to apply for the position of Embedded Developer. With a strong 
background in programming microcontrollers and a passion for creating efficient 
embedded systems, I am eager to bring my expertise to your team and contribute to the 
innovative solutions your company delivers.
In my experience, I have worked extensively with microcontrollers such as STM, 
ESP32, Arduino, and Texas Instruments, utilizing communication protocols including 
I2C, SPI, UART, CAN, and Ethernet. My projects have been powered by my proficiency 
in Linux and version control systems like Git, enabling me to develop robust and 
maintainable codebases. My journey in embedded systems began at Nocia Academy, 
where I honed my technical skills, and I have continued to expand my knowledge 
through personal and professional projects.
During my academic studies, I gained valuable experience using MATLAB for 
simulation and analysis, which deepened my understanding of system design and 
problem-solving. Furthermore, I have hands-on experience in electronics, including 
designing and assembling custom PCBsâ€”skills that have proven indispensable in my 
work. Professionally, I contributed to two commercial projects, where I successfully 
designed and implemented embedded solutions, demonstrating my ability to deliver 
results in real-world applications.
I am eager to contribute my technical expertise and dedication to excellence to 
your team.
Best regards
